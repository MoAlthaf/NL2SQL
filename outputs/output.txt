You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What are the average and highest ages for every type of pet?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT p.pettype, AVG(s.age) AS average_age, MAX(s.age) AS highest_age FROM student s JOIN has_pet hp ON s.stuid = hp.stuid JOIN pets p ON hp.petid = p.petid GROUP BY p.pettype;'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 student : stuid , lname , fname , age , sex , major , advisor , city_code | has_pet : stuid , petid | pets : petid , pettype , pet_age , weight | has_pet.stuid = student.stuid | has_pet.petid = pets.petid .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What are the full names of each car maker, along with their respective ids and the number of models they manufacture?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT T1.id, T1.maker, COUNT(T2.model) AS number_of_models FROM car_makers AS T1 LEFT JOIN model_list AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.maker GROUP BY T1.id, T1.maker;'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 continents : contid , continent | countries : countryid , countryname , continent | car_makers : id , maker , fullname , country | model_list : modelid , maker , model | car_names : makeid , model , make | cars_data : id , mpg , cylinders , edispl , horsepower , weight , accelerate , year | countries.continent = continents.contid | car_makers.country = countries.countryid | model_list.maker = car_makers.id | car_names.model = model_list.model | cars_data.id = car_names.makeid .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What is the total count of flights operated by Jetblue Airways?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
["SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_flights FROM flights JOIN airlines ON flights.airline = airlines.airline WHERE airlines.airline = 'JetBlue Airways';"].

Here is the database schema for context:
 airlines : uid , airline , abbreviation , country | airports : city , airportcode , airportname , country , countryabbrev | flights : airline , flightno , sourceairport , destairport | flights.destairport = airports.airportcode | flights.sourceairport = airports.airportcode .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What airline has the smallest number of flights and what are its abbreviation and country?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT T1.airline, T1.abbreviation, T1.country FROM airlines AS T1 JOIN flights AS T2 ON T1.uid = T2.airline GROUP BY T1.uid ORDER BY COUNT(*) LIMIT 1'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 airlines : uid , airline , abbreviation , country | airports : city , airportcode , airportname , country , countryabbrev | flights : airline , flightno , sourceairport , destairport | flights.destairport = airports.airportcode | flights.sourceairport = airports.airportcode .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What airports are not involved in any flights as either a departure or arrival point?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT airportcode FROM airports WHERE airportcode NOT IN (SELECT sourceairport FROM flights UNION SELECT destairport FROM flights);'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 airlines : uid , airline , abbreviation , country | airports : city , airportcode , airportname , country , countryabbrev | flights : airline , flightno , sourceairport , destairport | flights.destairport = airports.airportcode | flights.sourceairport = airports.airportcode .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What variety of templates are utilized by each document?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT d.document_name, t.template_type_code, COUNT(t.template_type_code) AS template_count FROM documents d JOIN templates t ON d.template_id = t.template_id GROUP BY d.document_name, t.template_type_code;'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 ref_template_types : template_type_code , template_type_description | templates : template_id , version_number , template_type_code , date_effective_from , date_effective_to , template_details | documents : document_id , template_id , document_name , document_description , other_details | paragraphs : paragraph_id , document_id , paragraph_text , other_details | templates.template_type_code = ref_template_types.template_type_code | documents.template_id = templates.template_id | paragraphs.document_id = documents.document_id .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What is the total count of documents associated with the template type that is classified as PPT?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
["SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT documents.document_id) AS total_count FROM documents JOIN templates ON documents.template_id = templates.template_id JOIN ref_template_types ON templates.template_type_code = ref_template_types.template_type_code WHERE ref_template_types.template_type_description = 'PPT';"].

Here is the database schema for context:
 ref_template_types : template_type_code , template_type_description | templates : template_id , version_number , template_type_code , date_effective_from , date_effective_to , template_details | documents : document_id , template_id , document_name , document_description , other_details | paragraphs : paragraph_id , document_id , paragraph_text , other_details | templates.template_type_code = ref_template_types.template_type_code | documents.template_id = templates.template_id | paragraphs.document_id = documents.document_id .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What is the total count of templates classified as CV templates?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
["SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM templates JOIN ref_template_types ON templates.template_type_code = ref_template_types.template_type_code WHERE ref_template_types.template_type_description = 'CV template';"].

Here is the database schema for context:
 ref_template_types : template_type_code , template_type_description | templates : template_id , version_number , template_type_code , date_effective_from , date_effective_to , template_details | documents : document_id , template_id , document_name , document_description , other_details | paragraphs : paragraph_id , document_id , paragraph_text , other_details | templates.template_type_code = ref_template_types.template_type_code | documents.template_id = templates.template_id | paragraphs.document_id = documents.document_id .

Here is the Question: What are the smallest version numbers and their corresponding template type codes?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT MIN(version_number) AS smallest_version_number, template_type_code FROM templates GROUP BY template_type_code;'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 ref_template_types : template_type_code , template_type_description | templates : template_id , version_number , template_type_code , date_effective_from , date_effective_to , template_details | documents : document_id , template_id , document_name , document_description , other_details | paragraphs : paragraph_id , document_id , paragraph_text , other_details | templates.template_type_code = ref_template_types.template_type_code | documents.template_id = templates.template_id | paragraphs.document_id = documents.document_id .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
["SELECT t.name FROM teacher t JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.teacher_id = ca.teacher_id JOIN course c ON ca.course_id = c.course_id WHERE c.course = 'math';"].

Here is the database schema for context:

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What is the highest number of final tables achieved by each poker player who has earned less than 200000?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT p.poker_player_id, MAX(pp.final_table_made) AS highest_final_tables FROM poker_player pp JOIN people p ON pp.people_id = p.people_id WHERE pp.earnings < 200000 GROUP BY p.poker_player_id;'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 poker_player : poker_player_id , people_id , final_table_made , best_finish , money_rank , earnings | people : people_id , nationality , name , birth_date , height | poker_player.people_id = people.people_id .

Here is the Question: What are the unique government forms and their respective total populations, given that the countries with these government forms have an average life expectancy exceeding 72 years?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT DISTINCT T1.governmentform , SUM(T1.population) FROM country AS T1 JOIN countrylanguage AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.countrycode WHERE T1.lifeexpectancy > 72 GROUP BY T1.governmentform'].

Here is the database schema for context:
 city : id , name , countrycode , district , population | sqlite_sequence : name , seq | country : code , name , continent , region , surfacearea , indepyear , population , lifeexpectancy , gnp , gnpold , localname , governmentform , headofstate , capital , code2 | countrylanguage : countrycode , language , isofficial , percentage | city.countrycode = country.code | countrylanguage.countrycode = country.code .

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

Here is the Question: What is the total amount of money paid by each owner for their dogs, and which owner has the highest total amount paid, along with their owner ID and zip code?.

Faulty SQL queries list (oldest to newest):
['SELECT o.owner_id, o.zip_code, SUM(c.charge_amount) AS total_amount_paid FROM owners o JOIN dogs d ON o.owner_id = d.owner_id JOIN charges c ON d.dog_id = c.charge_id GROUP BY o.owner_id, o.zip_code ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC LIMIT 1;'].

Here is the database schema for context:

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.

You are a SQL fixer. You are given a natural language question and a list of faulty SQL queries.
Your task is to fix the query without adding assumptions or extra details. Fix only the actual mistakes.
Most wrong queries are caused by unnecessary joins, columns, aggregations, or logic errors.
Fix errors such as invalid columns, join mismatches, or missing clauses. Your fix should be minimal and safe for execution.
Strictly follow the schema. Do not invent columns, tables, or joins not present in the schema.
Make sure the query follows the schema
.Return ONLY the fixed SQL query without any explanation.
